# Things that would be good to add

Roll runtime options into expandability
add support for prerequisite checks. (aka able to make sure the dockerfile is compatible)
Add additional host detection options to extension points
 - Detect alternative base OS xenial vs bionic
 - Detect different kernels/nvidia drivers

Add support for profiles

Provide a non-command line API for use in tooling such as unit tests.

Add a mechanism to declare dependencies
- other plugins like home really wants user, and nvidia could require X11 and separate that out
- required before, required after, and user required at the end(maybe keep as special case), snippets need ordering preambles don't
